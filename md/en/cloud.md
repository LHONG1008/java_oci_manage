# Web Cloud Management Panel Guide

[简体中文](../cloud.md)

The R-Bot client includes a full-featured Web cloud management panel. Manage Oracle Cloud, AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, SolusVM, VirtFusion, and Cloudflare DNS resources directly from your browser — fully aligned with the Telegram bot's capabilities.

---

## Access

After starting the client, visit:

```
https://YOUR_IP:9527
```

Log in and access the cloud management workbench via the view switcher from the host dashboard.

> First-time users need to configure cloud platform Profiles in the top bar "Settings" or via the `client_config` file.

---

## Overview Dashboard

The home page displays overview information for the current Profile:

| Card | Content |
|------|---------|
| **Cost** | Last 3 months spending details |
| **Traffic** | Last 3 months traffic usage |
| **Subscription** | Subscription type, payment, validity |
| **Quota** | Instance, network, storage quota usage |

Switch between Profiles to view different account information.

## Oracle Cloud Management

### Instance Management

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| View Instance List | Display all instances and status with boot volume info merged inline |
| Create Instance | Create a new instance with custom specs, image, and network |
| Quick Config | One-click AMD Micro 1C/1G or ARM A1 2C/12G preset that also fills image, disk, count, delay, and selects a public key |
| Create from Boot Volume | Boot an existing detached boot volume with its system and data intact; one instance at a time, and only in the volume's availability domain |
| Force ARM Boot | Improve ARM instance creation success rate for trial accounts (briefly uses paid features, use at your own risk) |
| Quick Boot | Quickly create an instance from saved configurations |
| Result Polling | After submitting, the page keeps checking task status and shows the final result rather than leaving you to wait on Telegram. If polling times out the result still arrives over Telegram |
| Start / Stop / Reboot | Basic instance operations |
| Terminate | Delete instance (optionally preserve boot volume) |
| Reset Image | Reinstall to initial OS image |
| Scale Up/Down | Adjust CPU and memory specs |

| Resize | Increase volume size (cannot shrink) |
| Adjust VPU | Modify performance units for IO boost |
| Batch VPU | Max out VPU for all volumes at once |
| Detach | Detach a volume from its instance. The instance must be stopped first |
| Attach Boot Volume | Attach a detached boot volume back onto an instance. The target instance must be stopped |
| Delete | Permanently delete block storage volume |

Detached boot volumes are collected in the "Unattached Boot Volumes" panel. When an instance has no boot volume attached, clicking "Boot Volume" expands and scrolls to that panel instead of reporting that there is nothing to show.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| View Instance List | Show Lightsail instances with public IP, bundle, blueprint, spec, region, and creation time |
| Create Instance | Switch the AWS creation page to the Lightsail product line, then pick region, availability zone, blueprint, bundle, key pair, name, and count. Bundles are filtered by blueprint platform and minimum compute, and locally stored public keys can be imported directly. Creation is asynchronous; on completion it lists the instances and public IPs and sends a Telegram notification |
| Start / Stop / Reboot | Basic power operations |
| Delete Instance | Delete a Lightsail instance (dangerous action, requires confirmation) |
| Traffic This Month | View inbound / outbound / total traffic and the bundle allowance; sourced from monitoring metrics, not billing usage |

### EC2 Firewall / Security Groups

The "Firewall" button on an EC2 instance card opens one dialog covering both groups and rules.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| View Groups | Split into groups attached to this instance and other groups in the same VPC |
| Attach / Detach | Add or remove a security group. An instance must keep at least one |
| Create and Attach | Create a new group by name and description and attach it immediately |
| Delete Group | Only possible while no resource references the group |
| Inbound / Outbound Rules | Add and remove rules across tcp / udp / icmp / icmpv6 / all protocols, port ranges, and IPv4 and IPv6 CIDRs |
| Rule Presets | SSH 22, HTTP 80, HTTPS 443, Ping, allow-all. One click fills the form; you still confirm before adding |
| Referencing Rules | Rules that reference another security group or a prefix list are shown read-only |

When a direction has no rules the panel spells out the consequence: no inbound rules means every inbound connection including SSH is refused; no outbound rules means the instance cannot reach the internet at all, apt and yum included.

## Cloud Monitoring

The "Cloud Monitoring" tab in the workbench. Two groups of rules, sharing one configuration with the bot's instance monitoring — change either side and the other follows.

### Traffic Guard (per account)

The OCI free allowance is 10240 GB per month; past that you are billed by usage. Set a monthly threshold per account.

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Watched Account | Configured per Profile |
| Threshold | In GB. Billing data lags 4–24 hours, so 9000 leaves room to act — a threshold at the ceiling arrives too late |
| Notify Only | Telegram message, instances untouched |
| Auto Shutdown | Immediately stops **every region's** instances on that account (SOFTSTOP). Fires without a second confirmation |
| Current Usage | Sourced from the Oracle billing API; not a real-time figure |

Before choosing auto shutdown: if you start the instances again while still over the threshold, they are stopped again within the hour. And if they stay off too long, Oracle may reclaim capacity quota for contended shapes like A1, meaning you have to win the capacity race again.

### Uptime Guard (all accounts)

| Toggle | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Stop Notifications | Checks every 8 minutes and sends a Telegram message on unexpected shutdown |
| Auto-Start | Starts stopped instances back up. Accounts shut down by Traffic Guard are excluded for the rest of the month so bandwidth does not keep burning |

---

## Domain Monitoring

The "Domain Monitoring" tab in the workbench. A daily job checks domain registration expiry and SSL certificate expiry, warning over Telegram as the dates approach.

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Add Domain | Add a single domain manually |
| Import from Cloudflare | Bulk-import hosted zones; duplicates are skipped, and anything left out by the cap is reported |
| Reminder Toggle | Enable or disable alerts per domain |
| Check Now | Probe immediately instead of waiting for the daily run |
| Search | Handles internationalized domains, converting to punycode automatically |
| Delete | Stop monitoring the domain |

Alert tiers are 30 / 14 / 7 / 1 days plus expired, deduplicated per tier so each one fires once.

Enter the registrable domain (`example.com`) rather than a subdomain — subdomains have no registration record, so domain expiry shows "unknown" while certificate checks still work. A failed check keeps the previous values and marks them unknown instead of overwriting good data.

Permissions: adding, importing, and enabling reminders require Lightning; disabling, deleting, viewing, and "Check now" do not.

---

## Settings

### Instance Monitoring

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Monitor Alerts | Periodic instance status monitoring with Telegram notifications |
| Auto-Start | Auto-start instances when anomalies detected |
| Daily Report | Scheduled push of cost and traffic reports |
| Health Check | Batch check all Profile account status |
| Boot Notification Account Type | Boot notifications mark the account as upgraded / regular (determined by OCI subscription paymentModel; left unmarked if uncertain) |

### Client Maintenance

"Client Upgrade" and "Client Logs" in the settings dropdown, matching the bot's "32. Upgrade Client" and "34. Latest Logs". Neither requires Lightning.

**Client Upgrade**

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Version Check | Shows the installed and latest versions. If the remote is unreachable it degrades to "cannot check" without blocking the page |
| Upgrade Now | Download the latest version and restart the client |
| Force Upgrade | Skip the version comparison and reinstall over the top — for when the version check itself is what is broken |
| Restart Service | Restart the client process without changing versions |

Upgrade and restart share a 5-minute cooldown; pressing either again inside that window tells you to wait. That is what stops two ends double-clicking into several installer processes trampling each other. Web terminals and SSH sessions drop during an upgrade and typically return within 1-3 minutes.

**Client Logs**

Read `log_r_client.log` straight from the browser: 100 / 300 / 1000 lines, keyword filtering, 5-second auto-refresh, and copy-all. The panel reports total lines, file size, and last-modified time; very large files are read back only over the last 2 MB.

### ACME Certificates

Configure Let's Encrypt auto-certificates in the Settings page. See [Web SSH Guide — SSL Certificates](./webssh.md#ssl-certificate-configuration) for details.

### Cloud Platform Configuration

Upload, edit, and manage cloud platform API configurations directly from the web interface across all 7 clouds (OCI/AWS/GCP/Azure/DO/SolusVM/VirtFusion) — no need to manually edit the `client_config` file.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| OCI Config Upload | Paste API config text + upload PEM key file, key_file path auto-configured |
| AWS Config Upload | Paste Access Key ID / Secret Access Key configuration |
| GCP Config Upload | Upload Service Account JSON key file, credentials auto-extracted |
| DO Config Upload | Paste DigitalOcean API Token |
| Azure Config Upload | Paste appId/password/tenant configuration |
| SolusVM Config Upload | Paste API URL and key configuration |
| VirtFusion Config Upload | Paste host/token/preset or use preset vendors for quick filling |
| Merge Mode | Duplicate Profile names are skipped with a warning, new Profiles are appended |
| Online Profile Editing | Configured Profiles are shown as a chip list; click to edit fields inline — no more SSH-ing in to edit files |
| Copy Profile to New Region | OCI / AWS Profiles can be cloned into another region in one click; only the region changes, and AWS availability-zone forms are normalized automatically |
| API Outbound Proxy | Configured per account at the bottom of the profile editor. Disabling requires "Remove Proxy" — clearing the fields and saving does not count |
| Delete Single Profile | Delete a specific Profile and clean up dangling default-Profile references |
| Secret Masking | Secrets / tokens are masked in the UI; plaintext is never sent to the browser |
| AWS Region Fix | Real-time hint and one-click fix when a region is mistyped as an availability zone (e.g. ap-southeast-1a) |
| Cloudflare Config | Edit Cloudflare credentials online. Both API Token (needs only Zone→DNS→Edit and Zone→Zone→Read) and Global API Key are supported; the token wins when both are present |
| Network Config | Edit local address, URL name, and startup mode online |
| Hot Reload | Configuration hot-reloads immediately on save; can also be refreshed manually — no client restart needed |

---

## Themes

The web interface supports 8 themes, each with both light and dark modes:

| Theme | Style |
|-------|-------|
| Classic | Default blue, clean and professional |
| Sakura | Pink tones, ACG / anime style |
| Cyber | Neon cyan-blue, techy |
| Ink | Golden antique, Chinese traditional |
| Aurora | Teal-purple gradient, northern lights |
| Stellar | Deep purple tones, starry sky |
| Abyss | Deep ocean blue-green, bioluminescent |
| Sunset | Warm orange-coral, cozy |

Switch themes using the selector in the top bar. Toggle the light/dark mode button to switch between light and dark modes.

---

## Cloud Instance Quick SSH

All cloud platforms (OCI / AWS EC2 / AWS Lightsail / GCP / Azure / DO / SolusVM / VirtFusion) provide an "SSH" button on instance cards. Click to jump directly to the terminal and connect to the instance — no manual connection setup needed. Each card also provides a one-click IP copy button.

---

## Multi-Cloud Health Check

A single panel summarizes total instance count, running/stopped status, and DNS info across all cloud platforms — a one-screen overview of multi-cloud asset health.

---

## Workbench Experience

- **Priority-Ordered Tabs** — Cloud platform tabs are arranged by frequency of use (OCI, AWS, Azure, GCP, DO, Cloudflare, SolusVM, VirtFusion)
- **Form-Based Config Upload** — Configuration upload switched to form inputs, no more manual formatting
- **Regrouped Action Buttons** — Instance action buttons grouped by usage frequency

---

## Online Support

Click the floating button in the bottom-right corner to open the built-in chat window for direct support communication. Image messages are supported. The icon supports **auto-hide** and **free dragging** to avoid blocking the operation area.
